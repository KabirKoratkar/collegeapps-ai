# Waypoint - Comprehensive Project Summary
Generated on: 2026-01-05

## 1. Project Overview
Waypoint is a unified "command center" for high school students to manage their college application process. It consolidates deadlines, essays, documents, and expert guidance into a single, premium visual dashboard.

## 2. Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+ Modules).
- **Backend (AI Server)**: Node.js with Express, integrated with OpenAI API for counselor logic.
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for all persistent data and user authentication.
- **UI/UX**: Custom design system using Inter (body) and Outfit (headings) fonts, Apple-style spacing, and modern gradients.
- **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel (Frontend) and Railway (Backend).

## 3. Major Accomplishments & Features

### A. Infrastructure & Integration
- **Supabase Integration**: Fully configured `supabase-config.js` with helpers for Auth, Profiles, Colleges, Essays, Tasks, Conversations, and Documents.
- **AI Server**: Established a separate backend server (`ai-server.js`) to handle secure OpenAI API calls for the "AI Counselor" featuring:
    - College requirement analysis.
    - Essay brainstorming and review logic.
    - Real-world college data integration.
- **Environment Management**: Dynamic configuration (`js/config.js`) that detects local vs. production environments.

### B. User Experience & Features
- **Authentication Flow**: Robust Signup, Login, and Sign-out functionality using Supabase Auth.
- **Multi-Step Onboarding**: A guided 3-step process for new users to set up their profile, major, and initial college list.
- **Intelligent Sidebar Navigation**: Consistent navigation across all internal pages.
- **Feature Modules**:
    - **Dashboard**: High-level overview of daily tasks, weekly goals, and upcoming deadlines.
    - **AI Counselor**: A chat-based assistant with conversation history and suggestion chips.
    - **Calendar View**: A comprehensive monthly grid for tracking tasks and deadlines with filtering capabilities.
    - **Essay Workspace**: A Notion-style editor for drafting essays with AI-powered brainstorm, outline, and rewrite tools.
    - **College Management**: A database-driven list of colleges with requirement tracking (LORs, test policies, platform types).
    - **Document Vault**: A secure file management system for transcripts, resumes, and awards.
    - **Analytics Dashboard**: Visual data representation including progress rings, college status charts, and activity heatmaps.

### C. Styling & Design System
- **Global CSS Architecture**: Separated into `design-system.css` (tokens), `components.css` (reusable UI), and `pages.css` (layout-specific).
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Implementation of glassmorphism, micro-animations, and curated color palettes (Blues/Purples).

## 4. Key Files & Structure
- `/` (Root): HTML pages for every feature.
- `/backend`: Node.js server, Supabase schema, and college data logic.
- `/js`: Modular JavaScript logic for each feature (auth, essays, calendar, counselor, etc.).
- `/css`: Three-tier styling system.
- `/assets`: Brand icons and media.

## 5. Development Milestones Reached
1. **Phase 1: MVP UI**: Created base HTML/CSS/JS pages with placeholder data.
2. **Phase 2: Backend & Auth**: Connected Supabase and implemented real user accounts.
3. **Phase 3: AI Counselor**: Built the chat interface and connected it to the OpenAI backend.
4. **Phase 4: Advanced Features**: Implemented the Calendar, Essay Workspace, and Document Vault.
5. **Phase 5: Analytics & Polish**: Added visual data tracking and refined the UI/UX across all resolutions.

## 6. Current State & Next Steps
- **State**: The application is a fully functional full-stack prototype running locally with Supabase connectivity.
- **Deployment**: Ready for production push to Vercel/Railway.
- **Future Goals**:
    - Integration with Common App API (if available).
    - Real-time deadline notifications.
    - Counselor-student collaboration features.
    - Performance optimization for large document sets.
